Keeping the scroll position in the browser between requests.

<p><b>Usage of this package</b></p>

A jsp page typically consists of one or more HTML
forms that contain WCF components like trees and tables.
Some user actions like expanding a tree node or sorting a table
column do support keeping the current scroll position.
<p>
WCF demo pages contain the necessary code. For new jsp
pages take the following steps

<ol>
<li>Include a reference to the scroller java script file (/wcf/scroller.js)
<li>Include the &lt;wcf:scroller/&gt; tag inside the HTML form
    that contains the components. This will generate additional
    hidden fields which are required by the java script code
<li>
</ol>

For new request handlers that require keeping the position add the
following function call to the handleRequest() method of your handler

<pre>
  public void handleRequest(RequestContext context) {
    Scroller.enableScroller(context);
    ...
  }</pre>

This ensures that the browser will keep it's scroll position
after the request is finished.
